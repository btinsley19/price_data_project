# price_data_project

This repository contains webscraping code for collecting data and a streamlit application that displays USC Price data.
The publication data is from the Google Scholar profiles of USC Price faculty, and the course data is from the USC classes website.

To view this data, you can navigate to the "data" folder.

## Running the application

Note that in running the webscraping code, you may have to change relative file paths for reading in the data (since I organized them in sub-folders for this repository)

make sure you have python and pip installed

git clone
cd into directory
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run home.py
