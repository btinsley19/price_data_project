# price_data_project

This repository contains webscraping code for collecting data and a streamlit application that displays USC Price data.
The publication data is from the Google Scholar profiles of USC Price faculty, and the course data is from the USC classes website.

To view this data, you can navigate to the "data" folder.

## Running the application
To run this application, clone this repository and ensure that streamlit is installed.
Navigate to the root of this directory and run
'''
streamlit run Home.py
'''


Note that in running the webscraping code, you may have to change relative file paths for reading in the data (since I organized them in sub-folders for this repository)


python version 3.10 comes with streamlit?
git clone
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run home.py
